I was fed up with some ad-bloated and freemium limited Scrum Poker apps, so I used bolt.new to make one for our team.

## Features
- 👥 Hosting multiple individual rooms at the same time (websockets!)
- 🔗 Join rooms via shared link - you don't have to mess with room codes (mostly)
- 🪙 Effortless hosting - the current version uses Github Pages & a managed NodeJS instance for websockets service (approx. $3 per month, well worth it at the moment)
- 🎉 Emoji reactions for no reason
- Story name field - completely useless (maybe gonna get rid of it)

## (Un)planned improvements / Nice to haves
- [ ] Create some logo
- [x] Add ability to change casted vote after the votes are revealed
- [ ] Get rid of Tailwind CSS (for some reason AI loves it)
- [ ] Allow editing of display name while being in a room (for giggles obviously)
- [ ] Add custom emoji reactions / improve existing reaction style & positioning
- [ ] Add "nudge" option to bother procrastinating estimators
